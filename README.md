# Self-Driving Car using YOLOv11

A real-time object detection system built using YOLOv11 and OpenCV.  
Modular structure inspired by GitHub projects, recreated from scratch with clean Git history.

## Features
- YOLOv11-based real-time detection
- Webcam input (tested)
- Modular code structure (`main.py`, `yolo/`, `utils/`)

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv yolocar_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
