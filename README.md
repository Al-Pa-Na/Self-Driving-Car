# Self-Driving Car Simulation ðŸš˜

A real-time simulation of an autonomous vehicleâ€™s core logic using computer vision and deep learning. This project detects objects, tracks movement, identifies lanes, decides steering actions, and provides visual feedback through an interactive UI.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv11  
- Object tracking with SORT  
- Lane detection using Hough Transform  
- Steering wheel rotation based on lane direction  
- Proximity-based collision alerts  
- Trail and path visualization  
- FPS counter and modular design  

## Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Al-Pa-Na/Self-Driving-Car.git
cd Self-Driving-Car
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Place the `yolo11n.pt` model file in the root directory.

## Usage

Run the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

To use a webcam instead of a video file, set `use_webcam = True` in `main.py`.

## Notes

* Sample outputs are saved in `output.avi` (ignored in git)
* Log of tested videos: `assets/videos/video_testing_notes.txt`
* Fully modular and built from scratch for simulation and experimentation

## Roadmap

* Lane departure warning system
* Speed estimation module
* Traffic sign detection and classification
